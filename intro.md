# Workshop Introduction and Overview

## Introduction to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure launched in October 2016 with a single region and core services across compute, storage,
and networking. Since then, Oracle Cloud has expanded to more than 70 services available in 29 cloud regions
worldwide with plans to reach 38 total regions by the end of 2021. OCI offers relational, OLAP, JSON, and NoSQL
databases, containers, Kubernetes, serverless functions, Spark, streaming, Jupyter notebooks, VMwareâ€“the range of
cloud services necessary for nearly any workload. In 2020 alone, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure launched nearly 400 new
services, features, and enhancements.
While other clouds were originally designed to support web and "scale out" cloud native applications, we saw an
opportunity to build our cloud differently. Most companies have three additional classes of applications: enterprise
applications that use relational databases, technical applications, and departmental applications. The first two have
typically required modifications or even rewrites to run in the cloud, while the third has often been replaced by SaaS
alternatives. Oracle has invested deeply to build core infrastructure services from the ground up to make it easy for
customers to run all five classes of applications. Atop Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Oracle also offers a broad and deep
array of cloud applications (SaaS) for nearly any departmental and industry-specific need.
